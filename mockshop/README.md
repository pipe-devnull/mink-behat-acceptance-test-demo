# Mock shop

A wee mock web shop used for demoing automated functional tests using Behat and Mink 

## Quickest way to get it working ever

You can of course add this content to any web server but for a quick start and playing around using the inbuilt PHP web server will work fine.

Your using PHP 5.4 ....

  cd mockshop
  php -S 0.0.0.0:1234

This will launch PHP's built in server on 0.0.0.0:1234, type that into a browser and you will see this beautiful mock shop!
